--- 
v1.0.4
- Added TypeLookup to help look up type from IServiceScope instance and assemblies present in the App domain
- Added unit test project
- Fixed bug in the seed migration using the DbContext assembly instead of the actual data context assembly

v1.0.5
- Removed setter for the AbstractContextSeeder.Order property. This is not needed. Could be added when there is a need for it
- Updated the migrator to include seeding and script execution post constructor initialization
- Removed verbose note when the updater is called. It's not necessary. Users are able to use the help argument to display help
- Updated the type lookup class to include method for getting all seedable objects

v1.0.6
	- Added ability to continue executing other script when one script fails to execute
	- Added ability to rollback transactions when a script fails. Successful transactions will be committed
	- Added information to script execution so that the name of the script is visible on the console before execution.
v1.0.7
	- The exit command is causing applications to terminate when ran in non-cli mode. Because the argument list is empty, DbUpdater automatically terminates the application. This is not the desired behavior
	  V1.0.7 removes the termination.
